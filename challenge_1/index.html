    <h1>Challenge #1</h1>
    <p>Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters). <br>

        Your task is to write some code to help them:<br>
        
        Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.<br>
        
        Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.<br>
        
        Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.<br>
        
        BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too<br>
        
        TEST DATA: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.</p>
